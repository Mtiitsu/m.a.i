# Medical Artifical Inteligence

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Gives info about medical issues. Keeps track of your pill intakes (if needed) due to older people being either forgetful or people simply have busy lives. Helps doctors to diagnose, since there are so many different medical conditions that it's impossible to know all of them from the top of your head.

## Background

* problem 1 - People often Google their problems
* problem 2 - People get misdiagnosed


## How is it used?

People type what they're experiencing and mai helps by giving necessesary information. Absolutely anyone can get pointers on what to do with certain things.

## Challenges

Possible info leaks. May misdiagnose as well. Won't be instantly avaliable.

## What next?

Goverments/Global figures fund the project and help it grow and benefit everyone.
